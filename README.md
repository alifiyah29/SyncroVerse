## Phase 1: Initial Setup & Environment Configuration

### Goal
Set up a development environment with Next.js, configure essential tools, and prepare the projectâ€™s core structure.

### Steps
1. **Initialize Next.js Project and Environment Configuration**
   - Installed Next.js, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and Axios.
   - Set up ESLint and Prettier for consistent coding standards.
   - Configured TypeScript for type safety and better code quality.
   - Integrated Tailwind CSS for styling.

2. **Project Structure & Boilerplate Code**
   - Set up the folder structure for components, pages, utilities, and state management.
   - Created a README.md outlining the initial setup and any dependencies.

## Phase 2: UI & Component Development

### Goal
Design and implement core UI components like the authentication pages, dashboard, document editor layout, and real-time chat UI.

### Steps
1. **Authentication Pages**
